####Tiny text editor that works in the Chrome, Offline or Online.

To use this, simply save it as a bookmark in Chrome, and click it whenever you want to use it.
You can use CTRL+S to save the file.

It also partially works in Firefox, however on CTRL+S it opens the default dialog as well.
Untested on other browsers sorry.
